	abstract = {Nestling begging behaviour may be an honest signal of need used by parents to adjust optimally both feeding rate and within-brood food allocation. Although several studies showed that mothers and fathers can be differentially responsive to nestling begging behaviour with one parent showing a stronger tendency to feed the offspring that beg the most, little information is yet available on whether offspring beg for food at different intensities from the mother than father. In the present study, we investigated in nestling barn owls whether the intensity of vocal begging behaviour in the presence of the mother and in the presence of the father is different. A difference is expected because reproductive tasks are divided between the sexes with fathers bringing more food items to the nest than mothers. The results show that although mothers transfer their prey item to one of the offspring more rapidly than fathers once in their nestbox, nestlings begged more intensely in the presence of their mother than in the presence of their father. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence that offspring vocalize to different levels in the presence of their mother than in the presence of their father.},

We make the distinction between questions regarding the population and questions regarding the particular clusters in the data. We show that the {AIC} in current use is not appropriate for the focus on clusters, and we propose instead the conditional Akaike information and its corresponding criterion, the conditional {AIC,} {cAIC.} The penalty term in {cAIC} is related to the effective degrees of freedom {rho} for a linear mixed model proposed by Hodges \& Sargent (2001); {rho} reflects an intermediate level of complexity between a fixed-effects model with no cluster effect and a corresponding model with fixed cluster effects. The {cAIC} is defined for both maximum likelihood and residual maximum likelihood estimation. A pharmacokinetics data application is used to illuminate the distinction between the two inference settings, and to illustrate the use of the conditional {AIC} in model selection. },

Hauck and Donner and Vaeth have identified situations in which the Wald statistic has poor power. We consider another example that is not in the classes discussed by those authors. We present data from a balanced one-way random effects analysis of variance {(ANOVA)} that illustrate the poor power of the Wald statistic compared to the usual F test. In this example the parameter of interest is the variance of the random effect. The power of the Wald test depends on the parameterization used, however, and a whole family of Wald statistics with p values ranging from 0 to 1 can be generated with power transformations of the random effect parameter.},

	abstract = {The {GLIMMIX} procedure was first released as a Web download add-on procedure to {SAS/STAT®} in {SAS}

{PROC} {GLIMMIX} between the {SAS} 9.1 and {SAS} 9.2 releases.
Enhancements fall into several categories: statistical estimation, model building, post-processing, and mis-
cellaneous other features. For example, new estimation methods and covariance structures enable parame-
ter estimation with reduced bias in more flexible generalized linear mixed models. A new statement provides
a comprehensive facility to test hypotheses about covariance parameters. New multiplicity corrections offer
more ways to adjust inferences.
The goal of this paper is to highlight the new estimation and inference techniques and to demonstrate their
usage with examples.},

This article explains the failure of the Wald test via the profile likelihood functions, which graphically look decidedly nonnormal.

achieve this by combining a technique from computer science known as ‘automatic

differentiation, is mostly unknown to statisticians, and hence we review basic ideas

the mixed-model literature. In general, our approach performs well in comparison

We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-t family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-t family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.

	abstract = {Upper respiratory tract disease {(URTD)} caused by Mycoplasma agassizii has been hypothesized to contribute to the decline of some wild populations of gopher tortoises {(Gopherus} polyphemus). However, the force of infection {(FOI)} and the effect of {URTD} on survival in free-ranging tortoise populations remain unknown. Using four years (2003-2006) of mark-recapture and epidemiological data collected from 10 populations of gopher tortoises in central Florida, {USA,} we estimated the {FOI} (probability per year of a susceptible tortoise becoming infected) and the effect of {URTD} (i.e., seropositivity to M. agassizii) on apparent survival rates. Sites with high ({\textgreater} or = 25\%) seroprevalence had substantially higher {FOI} (0.22 +/- 0.03; mean +/- {SE)} than low ({\textless} 25\%) seroprevalence sites (0.04 +/- 0.01). Our results provide the first quantitative evidence that the rate of transmission of M. agassizii is directly related to the seroprevalence of the population. Seropositive tortoises had higher apparent survival (0.99 +/- 0.0001) than seronegatives (0.88 +/- 0.03), possibly because seropositive tortoises represent individuals that survived the initial infection, developed chronic disease, and experienced lower mortality during the four-year span of our study. However, two lines of evidence suggested possible effects of mycoplasmal {URTD} on tortoise survival. First, one plausible model suggested that susceptible (seronegative) tortoises in high seroprevalence sites had lower apparent survival rates than did susceptible tortoises in low seroprevalence sites, indicating a possible acute effect of infection. Second, the number of dead tortoise remains detected during annual site surveys increased significantly with increasing site seroprevalence, from approximately 1 to approximately 5 shell remains per 100 individuals. If (as our results suggest) {URTD} in fact reduces adult survival, it could adversely influence the population dynamics and persistence of this late- maturing, long-lived species.},

	abstract = {Restricted maximum likelihood {(REML)} is now well established as a method for estimating the parameters of the general Gaussian linear model with a structured covariance matrix, in particular for mixed linear models. Conventionally, estimates of precision and inference for fixed effects are based on their asymptotic distribution, which is known to be inadequate for some small-sample problems. In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T\${\textasciicircum}2\$ type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different {REML} analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.},

Distributions of test statistics based on mixed models fitted to such data are unknown, but two recently developed methods for approximating the distributions of test statistics in mixed linear models have been included as options in the latest release of the {MIXED} procedure of {SAS{\textregistered}.} One method {(FC,} from Fai and Cornelius) computes degrees of freedom of an approximating F distribution for the test statistic using spectral decomposition of the hypothesis matrix together with repeated application of a method for single-degree-of-freedom tests. The other method {(KR,} from Kenward and Roger) adjusts the estimated covariance matrix of the parameter estimates, computes a scale adjustment to the test statistic, and computes the degrees of freedom of an approximating F distribution. Using the two methods, p values for a hypothesis of interest in the lady beetle study were quite different. Simulation studies on the Proc {MIXED} implementation of these methods showed that Type I error rates of both methods are affected by covariance structure complexity, sample size, and imbalance. Nonetheless, the {KR} method performs well in situations with fairly complicated covariance structures when sample sizes are moderate to small and the design is reasonably balanced. The {KR} method should be used in preference to the {FC} method, although it had inflated Type I error rates for complex covariance structures combined with small sample sizes.},

The practical use of the formulae is that we can derive closed-form Bartlett corrections for these models when the information matrix has a closed-form. Various Bartlett corrections are given for special models. The formulae have advantages for numerical purposes because they require only simple operations on matrices. Algebraically, they may be handled within computer systems such as {REDUCE.} Some numerical examples involving real data clarify the use of these formulae. /// Dans cet article nous \'{e}tudions des crit\`{e}res am\'{e}lior\'{e}s du rapport de vraisemblance aussi bien pour les param\`{e}tres dans la composante syst\'{e}matique que pour le param\`{e}tre de dispersion dans la classe des mod\`{e}les de dispersion {(J?rgensen,} 1987a).

	url = {http://www.bepress.com/jhubiostat/paper202/},
	abstract = {In linear mixed models, model selection frequently includes the selection of random effects. Two versions of the Akaike information criterion {(AIC)} have been
used, based either on the marginal or on the conditional distribution. We show that the marginal {AIC} is no longer an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the Akaike information, and in fact favours smaller models without random effects. For the conditional {AIC,} we show that ignoring estimation uncertainty in the random effects covariance matrix, as is common practice, induces a bias that leads to the
selection of any random effect not predicted to be exactly zero. We derive an analytic representation of a corrected version of the conditional {AIC,} which avoids
the high computational cost and imprecision of available numerical approximations.
An implementation in an R package is provided. All theoretical results are
illustrated in simulation studies, and their impact in practice is investigated in an
analysis of childhood malnutrition in Zambia.},

	abstract = {Many model search strategies involve trading off model fit with model complexity in a penalized goodness of fit measure. Asymptotic properties for these types of procedures in settings like linear regression and {ARMA} time series have been studied, but these do not naturally extend to nonstandard situations such as mixed effects models, where simple definition of the sample size is not meaningful. This paper introduces a new class of strategies, known as fence methods, for mixed model selection, which includes linear and generalized linear mixed models. The idea involves a procedure to isolate a subgroup of what are known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a member). This is accomplished by constructing a statistical fence, or barrier, to carefully eliminate incorrect models. Once the fence is constructed, the optimal model is selected from among those within the fence according to a criterion which can be made flexible. In addition, we propose two variations of the fence. The first is a stepwise procedure to handle situations of many predictors; the second is an adaptive approach for choosing a tuning constant. We give sufficient conditions for consistency of fence and its variations, a desirable property for a good model selection procedure. The methods are illustrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.},

	abstract = {1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models {(GLM)} and linear mixed models.},

Theoretical models come to different conclusions about the effects of inorganic soil nutrient levels on tolerance to {AMD}, and different plants have shown different relationships between these variables. To assign some order to these disparate patterns and to resolve conflicts among the models, the ‘limiting resources model’ {(LRM)} was developed. However, we believe that the {LRM} is actually comprised of several different models, which we describe. Our study marks the first comprehensive and simultaneous test of the entire {LRM} framework, treating it explicitly as separate models, which also evaluates the models’ underlying assumptions. We studied tolerance to {AMD} in laboratory-reared natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from three different regions of Europe, spanning a wide latitudinal gradient. We show that, in different populations of this species, basic responses to nutrients and damage are best described by different models, which are based on different assumptions and make different predictions. This demonstrates the need for complexity in our explanations, and suggests that no one existing model can account for all relationships between tolerance to {AMD} and nutrients. Our results also demonstrate that fruit production can provide a misleading approximation of fitness in A. thaliana, contrary to the common assumption in the literature.},

	abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical statistical models are increasingly being used to describe complex ecological processes. The data cloning ({DC)} method is a new general technique that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} algorithms to compute maximum likelihood ({ML)} estimates along with their asymptotic variance estimates for hierarchical models. Despite its generality, the method has two inferential limitations. First, it only provides Wald-type confidence intervals, known to be inaccurate in small samples. Second, it only yields {ML} parameter estimates, but not the maximized likelihood values used for profile likelihood intervals, likelihood ratio hypothesis tests, and information-theoretic model selection. Here we describe how to overcome these inferential limitations with a computationally efficient method for calculating likelihood ratios via data cloning. The ability to calculate likelihood ratios allows one to do hypothesis tests, construct accurate confidence intervals and undertake information-based model selection with hierarchical models in a frequentist context. To demonstrate the use of these tools with complex ecological models, we reanalyze part of Gause's classic Paramecium data with state—space population models containing both environmental noise and sampling error. The analysis results include improved confidence intervals for parameters, a hypothesis test of laboratory replication, and a comparison of the Beverton-Holt and the Ricker growth forms based on a model selection index.},

However, many hosts support mutualist guilds, and interactions among mutualists make the prediction of aggregate effects difficult. Here, we apply a factorial experiment to interactions of ‘guard’ crustaceans that defend their coral host from seastar predators. Predation was reduced by the presence of mutualists (15\% reduction in predation frequency and 45\% in volume of coral consumed). The frequency of attacks with both mutualists was lower than with a single species, but it did not differ significantly from the expected frequency of independent effects. In contrast, the combined defensive efficacy of both mutualist species reduced the volume of coral tissue lost by 73\%, significantly more than the 38\% reduction expected from independent defensive efforts, suggesting the existence of a cooperative synergy in defensive behaviors of ‘guard’ crustaceans. These emergent ‘multiple defender effects’ are statistically and ecologically analogous to the emergent concept of ‘multiple predator effects’ known from the predation literature.},

Veterinary services recently reported a resurgence of {CBPP} in the province of West Wellega, in the Ethiopian highlands. A research program was set up to estimate the epidemiological parameters of the within-herd infection spread. A follow-up survey was implemented in 71 sampled herds of the Boji district (West Wellega province). Fifteen herds were classified as newly infected and used in a serological- and clinical-incidence study. The overall 16-month cumulative sero-incidence risk was 34\%. Clinical cases were recorded for 39\% of the seropositive cattle; case-fatality risk was 13\%. There was no evidence of benefit on infection spread of {CBPP-control} measures used locally by farmers (isolation or antibiotic treatments of sick animals). This might be related to a lack of power in the statistical analyses or to a quality problem for the medications used (and more generally, for health-care delivery in the Boji district).},

Theory has predicted that females may invest differentially in response to mate attractiveness either to take advantage of her partner’s attractiveness or to compensate for it. The outcome can depend on the female’s expected future fitness. Empirical evidence also suggests that females adjust offspring size or fecundity according to the genetic or phenotypic traits of the male. Though the role of future fitness in empirical results is often difficult to assess, female experience has been shown to influence reproductive investment. This result could indicate that experience informs the female’s assessment of current and future mating opportunities (i.e., expected future fitness). Here, we tested whether female experience and mate attractiveness affected offspring size and number in sheepshead swordtails. We manipulated mate attractiveness by feeding males different diets, as females have been shown to prefer well-fed males. We found that females exposed to well-fed males, and then mated to poorly fed males, produced the largest offspring. Clutch size increased more rapidly with female size for females with mates on a poor diet, independent of female experience. Our results suggest that swordtail females elevate their investment in offspring size and number when mated to poorly fed males. These results demonstrate that maternal investment can be influenced by female social environment and experience, with underappreciated consequences for offspring fitness.},

	abstract = {The sigmoid dosage-mortality curve, secured so commonly in toxicity tests upon multicellular organisms, is interpreted as a cumulative normal frequency distribution of the variation among the individuals of a population in their susceptibility to a toxic agent, which susceptibility is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the dose applied. In support of this interpretation is the fact that when dosage is inferred from the observed mortality on the assumption that susceptibility is distributed normally, such inferred dosages, in terms of units called probits, give straight lines when plotted against the logarithm of their corresponding observed dosages. It is shown that this use of the logarithm of the dosage can be interpreted in terms either of the Weber-Fechner law or of the amount of poison fixed by the tissues of the organism. How this transformation to a straight regression line facilitates the precise estimation of the dosage-mortality relationship and its accuracy is considered in detail. Statistical methods are described for taking account of tests which result in 0 or 100 per cent, kill, for giving each determination a weight proportional to its reliability, for computing the position and slope of the transformed dosage-mortality curve, for measuring the goodness of fit of the regression line to the observations by the X2 test, and for calculating the error in position and in slope and their combined effect at any log. dosage. The terminology and procedures are consistent with those used by R. A. Fisher, who has contributed an appendix on the case of zero survivors. Except for a table of common logarithms, all the tables required to utilise the methods described are given either in the present paper or in Fisher's book. A numerical example selected from Strand's experiments upon Tribolium confusum with carbon disulphide has been worked out in detail.},

	abstract = {Mixed-effect models are frequently used to control for the nonindependence of data points, for example, when repeated measures from the same individuals are available. The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type {II} errors as well.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using {LMEMs} for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that {LMEMs} generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of {LMEMs} including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only {LMEMs} used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal {LMEMs} should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

A key part in the analysis of data is model selection, which often aims to choose a parsimonious model with other desirable properties from a possibly very large set of candidate statistical models. Over the last 5–10 years the literature on model selection in linear mixed models has grown extremely rapidly. The problem is much more complicated than in linear regression because selection on the covariance structure is not straightforward due to computational issues and boundary problems arising from positive semidefinite constraints on covariance matrices. To obtain a better understanding of the available methods, their properties and the relationships between them, we review a large body of literature on linear mixed model selection. We arrange, implement, discuss and compare model selection methods based on four major approaches: information criteria such as {AIC} or {BIC}, shrinkage methods based on penalized loss functions such as {LASSO}, the Fence procedure and Bayesian techniques.},

	abstract = {Abstract Interspecific aggression between ecologically similar species may influence geographic limits by mediating competitive exclusion at the range edge. Advertisement signals that mediate competitive interactions within species may also provide social information that contributes to behavioral dominance and spatial segregation among species. We studied the mechanisms underlying altitudinal range limits in Neotropical singing mice (Scotinomys), a genus of muroid rodent in which males vocalize to repel rivals and attract mates. We first delineated replacement zones and described temperature regimes on three mountains in Costa Rica and Panama where Chiriquí singing mice (S. xerampelinus) abruptly replace Alston’s singing mice (S. teguina). Next, we conducted interspecific behavioral trials and reciprocal removal experiments to examine if interspecific aggression mediated species replacement. Finally, we performed reciprocal playback experiments to investigate whether response to song matched competitive interactions. Behavioral trials and removal experiments suggest that S. xerampelinus is behaviorally dominant and excludes S. teguina from higher, cooler altitudes. Playback experiments indicate that subordinate S. teguina is silenced and repelled by heterospecific song, whereas S. xerampelinus responded to heterospecifics with approach and song rates comparable to responses to conspecifics. Thus, interspecific communication reflects underlying dominance and suggests that acoustic signaling contributes to altitudinal zonation of ecologically similar congeners. Our findings implicate the use of social information in structuring spatial distributions of animal communities across landscapes and provide insight into how large-scale patterns are generated by individual interactions.},

For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2,λ) penalty with λ→0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior. Our default method provides better estimates of model parameters and standard errors than the maximum likelihood or the restricted maximum likelihood estimators. The log-gamma family can also be used to convey substantive prior information. In either case—pure penalization or prior information—our recommended procedure gives nondegenerate estimates and in the limit coincides with maximum likelihood as the number of groups increases.},

Here, we present phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models ({PGLMMs)} that can statistically test a wide variety of phylogenetic patterns in community structure. In contrast to most current statistical approaches that rely on community metrics and randomization tests, {PGLMMs} are model-based statistics that fit observed presence/absence data to underlying hypotheses about the distributions of species among communities. We built four {PGLMMs} to address (1) phylogenetic patterns in community composition, (2) phylogenetic variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients among communities, (3) phylogenetic repulsion in which closely related species are less likely to co-occur, and (4) trait-based variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients. We also built a fifth {PGLMM} to test a key underlying assumption of phylogenetic community structure: that phylogenetic information serves as a surrogate for trait information about species; this model tests whether the introduction of trait information can explain all variation in species occurrences among communities, leaving no phylogenetic residual variation. We assessed the performance of these {PGLMMs} using community simulation models and show that {PGLMMs} have equal or greater statistical power than alternative approaches currently in the literature. Finally, we illustrate the {PGLMM} advantage of fitting a model to data by showing how variation in species occurrences among communities can be partitioned into phylogenetic and site-specific components, and how fitted models can be used to predict the co-occurrence of phylogenetically related species.},

The simulation results in the literature suggest that some of these methods work quite well in practice; the theoretical results are limited and more mixed in their conclusions. For example, {McCullagh} reached negative conclusions about the use of non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues by discussing the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of the bootstrap observations are not really useful in assessing consistency.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Logistic random effects models are a popular tool to analyze multilevel also called hierarchical data with a binary or ordinal outcome. Here, we aim to compare different statistical software implementations of these models.{METHODS}:We used individual patient data from 8509 patients in 231 centers with moderate and severe Traumatic Brain Injury ({TBI}) enrolled in eight Randomized Controlled Trials ({RCTs}) and three observational studies. We fitted logistic random effects regression models with the 5-point Glasgow Outcome Scale ({GOS}) as outcome, both dichotomized as well as ordinal, with center and/or trial as random effects, and as covariates age, motor score, pupil reactivity or trial. We then compared the implementations of frequentist and Bayesian methods to estimate the fixed and random effects. Frequentist approaches included R (lme4), Stata ({GLLAMM}), {SAS} ({GLIMMIX} and {NLMIXED}), {MLwiN} ([R]{IGLS}) and {MIXOR}, Bayesian approaches included {WinBUGS}, {MLwiN} ({MCMC}), R package {MCMCglmm} and {SAS} experimental procedure {MCMC}.Three data sets (the full data set and two sub-datasets) were analysed using basically two logistic random effects models with either one random effect for the center or two random effects for center and trial. For the ordinal outcome in the full data set also a proportional odds model with a random center effect was fitted.{RESULTS}:The packages gave similar parameter estimates for both the fixed and random effects and for the binary (and ordinal) models for the main study and when based on a relatively large number of level-1 (patient level) data compared to the number of level-2 (hospital level) data. However, when based on relatively sparse data set, i.e. when the numbers of level-1 and level-2 data units were about the same, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches showed somewhat different results. The software implementations differ considerably in flexibility, computation time, and usability. There are also differences in the availability of additional tools for model evaluation, such as diagnostic plots. The experimental {SAS} (version 9.2) procedure {MCMC} appeared to be inefficient.{CONCLUSIONS}:On relatively large data sets, the different software implementations of logistic random effects regression models produced similar results. Thus, for a large data set there seems to be no explicit preference (of course if there is no preference from a philosophical point of view) for either a frequentist or Bayesian approach (if based on vague priors). The choice for a particular implementation may largely depend on the desired flexibility, and the usability of the package. For small data sets the random effects variances are difficult to estimate. In the frequentist approaches the {MLE} of this variance was often estimated zero with a standard error that is either zero or could not be determined, while for Bayesian methods the estimates could depend on the chosen "non-informative" prior of the variance parameter. The starting value for the variance parameter may be also critical for the convergence of the Markov chain.},

A {GLMM} contains parameters common to all clusters (fixed regression effects and variance components) and cluster-specific parameters. The latter parameters are assumed to be randomly drawn from a population distribution. The parameters of this population distribution (the variance components) have to be estimated together with the fixed effects. We focus on the case in which the cluster-specific parameters are normally distributed. The cluster-specific effects are integrated out of the likelihood so that the fixed effects and variance components can be estimated. Unfortunately, the integral over the cluster-specific effects is intractable for most {GLMMs} with a normal mixing distribution. Within a classical statistical framework, we distinguish between two broad classes of methods to handle this intractable integral: methods that rely on a numerical approximation to the integral and methods that use an analytical approximation to the integrand. Finally, we present an overview of available methods for testing hypotheses about the parameters of {GLMMs}.},

	abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is a well-recognized concern for observational data in general, and more specifically for spatial data in ecology. Generalized linear mixed models ({GLMMs}) with spatially autocorrelated random effects are a potential general framework for handling these spatial correlations. However, as the result of statistical and practical issues, such {GLMMs} have been fitted through the undocumented use of procedures based on penalized quasi-likelihood approximations ({PQL}), and under restrictive models of spatial correlation. Alternatively, they are often neglected in favor of simpler but more questionable approaches. In this work we aim to provide practical and validated means of inference under spatial {GLMMs}, that overcome these limitations. For this purpose, a new software is developed to fit spatial {GLMMs}. We use it to assess the performance of likelihood ratio tests for fixed effects under spatial autocorrelation, based on Laplace or {PQL} approximations of the likelihood. Expectedly, the Laplace approximation performs generally slightly better, although a variant of {PQL} was better in the binary case. We show that a previous implementation of {PQL} methods in the R language, {glmmPQL}, is not appropriate for such applications. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of a bootstrap procedure for correcting the small sample bias of the tests, which applies also to non-spatial models.},

Developing {RSFs} using data from {GPS} telemetry can be problematic due to serial autocorrelation, but modern analytical techniques can help to compensate for this correlation. We used telemetry locations from 18 woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou in Saskatchewan, Canada, to compare marginal (population-specific) generalized estimating equations ({GEEs}), and conditional (subject-specific) generalized linear mixed-effects models ({GLMMs}), for developing resource selection functions at two spatial scales. We evaluated the use of empirical standard errors, which are robust to misspecification of the correlation structure. We compared these approaches with destructive sampling. Statistical significance was strongly influenced by the use of empirical vs. model-based standard errors, and marginal ({GEE}) and conditional ({GLMM}) results differed. Destructive sampling reduced apparent habitat selection. k-fold cross-validation results differed for {GEE} and {GLMM}, as it must be applied differently for each model. Synthesis and applications. Due to their different interpretations, marginal models (e.g. generalized estimating equations, {GEEs}) may be better for landscape and population management, while conditional models (e.g. generalized linear mixed-effects models, {GLMMs}) may be better for management of endangered species and individuals. Destructive sampling may lead to inaccurate resource selection functions ({RSFs}), but {GEEs} and {GLMMs} can be used for developing {RSFs} when used with empirical standard errors.},

	abstract = {Regression models incorporating random effects are being used with increasing frequency to examine variations in outcomes following the provision of medical care across providers. These models frequently assume a normal distribution for the provider-specific random effects. However, the validity of this assumption is rarely explicitly tested. We used Monte Carlo simulation methods to examine the impact of misspecifying the distribution of the random effects on estimation of and inference about both the fixed effect and the random effects in hierarchical logistic regression models. We demonstrated that estimation and inferences concerning the fixed effects was insensitive to misspecification of the distribution of the random effects. However, estimation and inferences concerning the provider-specific random effects was affected by model misspecification. In particular, estimation of cluster-specific random effects and the coverage of the associated 95\% confidence intervals were particularly poor for individual random effects that came from the extreme tails of t-distributions with low degrees of freedom. These findings have important implications for those using hierarchical logistic regression models to identify health care providers with either exceptionally high or low rates of an outcome.},
