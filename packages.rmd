Install primary GLMM-fitting packages (and a variety of extras):

```{r}
pkgs1 <- c("lme4","MCMCglmm","blme","ggplot2","gridExtra",
           "coda","aods3","plotMCMC","bbmle","pbkrtest",
           "plotrix","emdbook","Hmisc","reshape2","plyr",
           "numDeriv","dplyr","R2admb","glmmML","spGLMM",
           "R2jags","RLRsim","lmerTest","mlmRev","MEMSS",
           "gamm4","afex","arm","cAIC4","HLMdiag","influence.ME",
           "pedigreemm","lsmeans","robustlmm","agridat",
           "AICcmodavg","benchmark","metafor","multcomp",
           "MuMIn","ordinal","SASmixed","texreg","stargazer",
           "rockchalk")
install.packages(pkgs1,dependencies=TRUE)
## get INLA:
source("http://www.math.ntnu.no/inla/givemeINLA.R")
```

`grid`, `nlme`, `MASS` should not need to be (re)installed, as they come with a standard R installation.

`coefplot2` and `glmmADMB` need to be gotten from off-CRAN repos:

```{r}
install.packages("glmmADMB",
   repos=c("http://www.hafro.is/~arnima/repos", getOption("repos")))
install.packages("coefplot2",
    repos=c("http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/bolker/R", getOption("repos"))
```
May need to add `type="source"` to one or both of these.

Recommended versions (higher is OK):
```{r}
##      lme4  glmmADMB  MCMCglmm      blme  pbkrtest coefplot2      coda
##     1.1.7     0.7.7      2.18     1.0.2     0.3.8   0.1.3.2    0.16.1
##     aods3     bbmle
##     0.4.1    1.0.16
```
